# Maze Generator and Solver

This project is a C++ application that generates a random maze and solves it using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The maze is represented as a 2D grid where walls and paths are indicated by different characters.

## Features

- **Maze Generation:** Generates a random maze using a recursive backtracking algorithm.
- **Maze Solving:** Solves the generated maze using a DFS algorithm.
- **Visualization:** Prints the maze before and after solving.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **g++**: The GNU C++ compiler.
- **CMake**: For managing the build process (if using CMake).

### Building the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sthaarwin/Maze-Solver.git
   cd Maze-Solver
